# WASM2010

WASM2010 is a set of tools that provides the user with an experimental environment for CS2010, a hardware architecture designed by the Higher Technical School of Computer Engineering of the University of Seville for academic purposes. Composed at its core of an assembler and an emulator, it allows the user to assemble programs, load them into a virtual CS2010 machine, and understand their operation through step-by-step debugging or real-time execution, as well as to interact with the computer using input and
output devices.

While the user interaction originates in a web application, its core is isolated in a WebAssembly module —a low-level portable bytecode—
written in C, thus allowing its reuse in web and desktop projects that wish to incorporate or extend its functionality.
